# Terraform Provider for Magalu Cloud

Magalu Cloud (MGC) it's the first **Brazilian** Cloud with global scale. We speak your language, we understand your reality and we are ready to accelerate your business.

The Magalu Cloud provider is used to configure your Magalu Cloud infrastructure.

With the provider you can manage:

- Availability zones
- Block Storage (volumes, snapshots, VM attach)
- DBaaS (instances, replications)
- Container Registry (registries)
- Kubernetes (clusters, nodepools)
- Object Storage (Buckets)
- Virtual Machines (instances, snapshots)
- VPCs (subnets, security rules, public IPs)
- SSH Keys

If you don't already have an account on Magalu Cloud (MGC) you can create one through our [console](https://console.magalu.cloud/login).

## Getting Started

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
We have guides for getting started with Terraform and Magalu Cloud Products in the Guides section.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mgc = {

  }
}

provider "mgc" {
  api_key    = var.api_key
  region     = var.region
  env        = var.env
  access_key = var.access_key
