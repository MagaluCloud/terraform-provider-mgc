# mgc_virtual_machine_instances (Resource)

Manages virtual machine instances in Magalu Cloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mgc_virtual_machine_instances" "basic_instance" {

## Schema

### Required

- `image` (String) The image name used for the virtual machine instance.
- `machine_type` (String) The machine type name of the virtual machine instance.
- `name` (String) The name of the virtual machine instance.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `allocate_public_ipv4` (Boolean, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) If true, the primary network interface will be created with a public IPv4 address.
A Public IPv4 address resource will be created and associated with you tenant, when deleting the instance the Public IPv4 will not be deleted and charges may apply.
If false, the primary network interface will be created without a public IPv4 address.
Default is false.
This attribute can only be used when "network_interface_id" is not set.
- `availability_zone` (String) The availability zone of the virtual machine instance.
- `creation_security_groups` (List of String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) List of security group IDs to be associated with the primary network interface on creation.
If not specified, the default security group of the VPC will be used.
For manage security groups after the instance creation, use the network resources.
Find out more in the documentation guides.
This attribute can only be used when "network_interface_id" is not set.
- `ssh_key_name` (String) The name of the SSH key associated with the virtual machine instance. Not required for Windows instances.
- `user_data` (String) User data for instance initialization.
- `vpc_id` (String) The VPC ID where the primary network interface will be created.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the virtual machine instance was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the virtual machine instance.
- `ipv4` (String) The primary network interface public IPv4 address of the virtual machine instance.
- `ipv6` (String) The primary network interface IPv6 address of the virtual machine instance.
- `local_ipv4` (String) The primary network interface IPv4 address of the virtual machine instance.
- `network_interface_id` (String) The primary network interface ID is the primary interface used for network traffic that will be associated with the instance.
If not specified, a new network interface will be created in the specified VPC or in the default VPC if no VPC is specified.
Read the documentation guides for more details.
- `network_interfaces` (Attributes List) The network interfaces attached to the virtual machine instance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--network_interfaces))

<a id="nestedatt--network_interfaces"></a>
### Nested Schema for `network_interfaces`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The ID of the network interface.
- `ipv4` (String) The IPv4 address of the network interface.
- `ipv6` (String) The IPv6 address of the network interface.
- `local_ipv4` (String) The local IPv4 address of the network interface.
- `name` (String) The name of the network interface.
- `primary` (Boolean) Whether the network interface is primary.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import mgc_virtual_machine_instances.basic_instance 123
```
