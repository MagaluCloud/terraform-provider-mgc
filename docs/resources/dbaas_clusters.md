# mgc_dbaas_clusters (Resource)

Manages a DBaaS (Database-as-a-Service) Cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mgc_dbaas_clusters" "my_cluster" {
  name                  = "test-cluster"
  user                  = "clusteradmin"
  password              = "aVerySecureClu$terP@ssw0rd"
  engine_name           = "mysql"
  engine_version        = "8.0"
  instance_type         = var.instance_type_label_cluster
  volume_size           = 100
  volume_type           = "CLOUD_NVME15K"
  backup_retention_days = 7
  backup_start_at       = "03:00:00"
  parameter_group_id    = mgc_dbaas_parameter_groups.cluster_pg.id
}

resource "mgc_dbaas_clusters" "my_cluster_no_parameter_group" {
  name                  = "test-cluster-nopg-${random_pet.name.id}"
  user                  = "clusteradmin2"
  password              = "anotherS&cureP@sswordClu1"
  engine_name           = "mysql"
  engine_version        = "8.0"
  instance_type         = var.instance_type_label_cluster
  volume_size           = 50
  backup_retention_days = 5
  backup_start_at       = "02:00:00"
}

### Read-Only

- `addresses` (Attributes List) Network addresses for connecting to the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--addresses))
- `apply_parameters_pending` (Boolean) Indicates if parameters changes are pending application.
- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of when the cluster was created.
- `engine_id` (String) ID of the database engine.
- `finished_at` (String) Timestamp of when the cluster last finished an operation.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the DBaaS cluster. Generated automatically on creation.
- `instance_type_id` (String) ID of the instance type.
