## Magalu Cloud Provider

The MGC provider allows you to use Terraform to manage your resources on Magalu Cloud.

With the provider, you can manage:

- VPCs (subnets, security rules, public IPs)
- Virtual Machines (instances, snapshots)
- Kubernetes (clusters, node pools)
- DBaaS (instances, replications)
- Block Storage (volumes, snapshots, VM attachment)
- Object Storage

The provider is currently under development, so new Magalu Cloud resources will be supported soon.
